<p>Hello {{{givenName}}}</p>\n \
<p>A request has been made to change the email address associated with your account.</p>\n \
<p>An email should be waiting for you at the address {{{newEmail}}}. Once the address has been verified (by clicking the link in the email), it will become the new email associated with your account.</p>\n \
<p>If the link is not pressed by {{dateUtil emailVericationTTL format="EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z"}}, the link will expire and your current email address will continue to receive all correspondence.</p>\n \
<p>If you did not make this request, it means that someone else has taken control of your account.</p>\n \
